### Reproduce the analysis

Our analyses are done in [R](http://r-project.org) and can be found in the `*.r` and `*.rmd` files.

The `renv.lock` file can be used with the [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv) or [`capsule`](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/capsule) packages to recreate the R package dependencies.

Additional project files, as well as our map graphic created in QGIS (below), are available from [our Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1K_jkLaXDcqO9pG9dbgB59LDBAJGC49GI?usp=sharing).
